      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father one day asked me &lt;em&gt;how could I plot lighting in an office or noise in a working environment as a heatmap on top of a floormap?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;My first answer was something that sounds like &lt;em&gt;I can easily write down a python script that does that for you.&lt;/em&gt; It was not easy! &lt;br&gt;&#xA;It took me some days to figure out the best way to do it, and probably my approach is not the best, but it does the job! My first project that started from zero, and solves a &lt;strong&gt;real-life&lt;/strong&gt; problem: this software takes the data written in an Excel file, and then plots it on a floor-map. Check it out for more details!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Whale recognition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the final exam of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags/modules/comp/machinelearning/&#34;&gt;MPAGS Machine Learning course&lt;/a&gt; (access the 2021-2022 course pages to see the statement of my assessment being submitted - and passed). I was inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data&#34;&gt;this Kaggle competition&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to try and create a Machine Learning algorithm capable of identifying marine mammals just by a picture of the dorsal fin. Since I am a beginner (or at least I was at the time), I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bdsaglam/happy-whale-512?select=sample_submission.csv&#34;&gt;this dataset&lt;/a&gt;, that consists of the already resized and rotated images of the original dataset (hence it is supposedly easier to work with it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advent of Code 2022</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just by chance, a couple of years ago I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;, and interesting project that I personally recommend to those who want to challenge themselves in doing some code-related problem solving, or who want to test/improve their knowledge of a given programming language. This year I wanted to deepen my knowledge of C++, hence the poor quality of my code. I will improve for sure!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://enricomartello.github.io/img/aoc22.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://enricomartello.github.io/img/aoc22.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
