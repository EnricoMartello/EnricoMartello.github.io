      <description>I am one of the founding members of De sidus and I am responsible for the scientific sector. Please, feel free to get in touch and ask for collaborations! We want to spread the love for culture and knowledge, may it be scientific or not. Take a look at our webpage (Italian only, at the moment) to find out what we are up to!</description>

      <description>I collaborated with the EPS Young Minds section Catania in their project involving High School students and Arduino. The goal of the project was to build a network of sensors able to track down pollution levels in different areas of the city, in order to sensitize young people awareness of the problem of pollution, teach them how do sensors work and how do tracking and measuring work.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of stable and unstable population dynamics in a nonlinear non-Hermitian mechanical dimer</title>
      <link>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_coexistence/</link>

      <description>We experimentally and theoretically investigate the dynamics of Hatano-Nelson model on two sites (dimer), and then we make the non-reciprocal hoppings depend on the population imbalance between the two sites, thus introducing the non-Hermiticity in a dynamical manner. In the latter case we find that we can tune from stable to unstable population dynamics by simply changing the initial phase difference between the two sites.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Adiabatic Non-Hermitian Berry Phase in Feedback-Coupled Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_measuring/</link>

      <guid>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_measuring/</guid>
      <description>In this work we verify experimentally that the adiabatic non-Hermitian Berry phase is a purely geometrical effect that leads to significant amplification and damping of the amplitude also for non-cyclical paths within the parameter space even when all eigenenergies are real. We further observe a non-Hermitian analog of the Aharonov&amp;ndash;Bohm solenoid effect.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mechanical Lattices with Synthetic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_synthetic/</link>

      <guid>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_synthetic/</guid>
      <description>We experimentally engineer synthetic lattice Hamiltonians in our mechanical system, with control over local site energies and loss and gain as well as control over the complex hopping between oscillators. Beyond linear terms, we experimentally demonstrate how this measurement-based feedback approach opens the window to independently introducing nonlinear interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Grassmannization of the 3D Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_grassmannization/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://enricomartello.github.io/publications/paper_grassmannization/</guid>
      <description>The application of Feynman’s diagrammatic technique to classical link models with local constraints seems impossible due to (i) the absence of a free Gaussian theory on top of which the perturbative expansion can be constructed, and (ii) Dyson’s collapse argument, rendering the perturbative expansion divergent. However, we show for the classical 3D Ising model how both problems can be circumvented using a Grassmann representation. This makes it possible to obtain an expansion of the spin correlation function and the magnetic susceptibility in terms of the inverse temperature in the thermodynamic limit, through which the values for the critical temperature and critical index are evaluated within 1.</description>

      <description>In this talk I presented our most recent work at the University of Catania. It was the first time I ever presented my work!
We measured for the first time the Berry phase in the case of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a mechanical metamaterial.</description>

      <description>I have been helping people at 6bit by testing and adding new features to Graide, a platform that reduces grading workload while increasing the quality of feedback given to students. Take a look at how it works!
I have been demo-ing at L@S2022 where the issues related to teaching and learning at scale have been discussed.</description>

      <description>For the first time since I began my PhD, I was able to spend more time traveling for conferences. In particular, I presented this poster at the Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Meeting, at the University of Warwick, then a few weeks later I took part to the conference on Condensed Matter and Quantum Materials (CMQM) organised by the Institute of Physics (IoP) at the University of Bath, and finally I have presented it at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, for the conference on Designing Out of Eequilibrium many-body Quantum systems (DesOEQ).</description>

      <description>My father one day asked me how could I plot lighting in an office or noise in a working environment as a heatmap on top of a floormap? My first answer was something that sounds like I can easily write down a python script that does that for you. It was not easy! It took me some days to figure out the best way to do it, and probably my approach is not the best, but it does the job!</description>

      <description>I presented this poster at the Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Meeting, held in Warwick. For more details about this work, take a look at the paper. As it is a large file, it might take some time to download it - be patient :)</description>

      <description>From 17th to 20th of September, right before I graduated my MSc, I had the chance to take part (and help managing, together with other MSc students) the 11th Italian Quantum Information Science Conference (IQIS) organised in Catania. Here I presented the work I had carried out during my Erasmus as part of Lode Pollet&amp;rsquo;s group. At the time I presented a different version of the poster. The one you find here is a &amp;ldquo;more standalone&amp;rdquo; version, that I presented at the Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Meeting, held in Warwick.</description>

      <description>This was the final exam of the MPAGS Machine Learning course (access the 2021-2022 course pages to see the statement of my assessment being submitted - and passed). I was inspired by this Kaggle competition, and I decided to try and create a Machine Learning algorithm capable of identifying marine mammals just by a picture of the dorsal fin. Since I am a beginner (or at least I was at the time), I used this dataset, that consists of the already resized and rotated images of the original dataset (hence it is supposedly easier to work with it).</description>

      <description>Just by chance, a couple of years ago I came across the Advent of Code, and interesting project that I personally recommend to those who want to challenge themselves in doing some code-related problem solving, or who want to test/improve their knowledge of a given programming language. This year I wanted to deepen my knowledge of C++, hence the poor quality of my code. I will improve for sure!</description>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>
