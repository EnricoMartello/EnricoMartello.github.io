      <description>In this talk I presented our most recent work at the University of Catania. It was the first time I ever presented my work!
We measured for the first time the Berry phase in the case of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a mechanical metamaterial.</description>

      <description>The application of Feynman’s diagrammatic technique to classical link models with local constraints seems impossible due to (i) the absence of a free Gaussian theory on top of which the perturbative expansion can be constructed, and (ii) Dyson’s collapse argument, rendering the perturbative expansion divergent. However, we show for the classical 3D Ising model how both problems can be circumvented using a Grassmann representation. This makes it possible to obtain an expansion of the spin correlation function and the magnetic susceptibility in terms of the inverse temperature in the thermodynamic limit, through which the values for the critical temperature and critical index are evaluated within 1.</description>
