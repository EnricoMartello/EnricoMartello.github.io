      <description>This was the final exam of the MPAGS Machine Learning course (access the 2021-2022 course pages to see the statement of my assessment being submitted and passed). I was inspired by this Kaggle competition, and I decided to try and create a Machine Learning algorithm capable of identifying marine mammals just by a picture of the dorsal fin. Since I am a beginner (or at least I was at the time), I used this dataset, that consists of the already resized and rotated images of the original dataset (hence it is supposedly easier to work with it).</description>
