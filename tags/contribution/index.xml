      <description>I collaborated with the EPS Young Minds section Catania in their project involving High School students and Arduino. The goal of the project was to build a network of sensors able to track down pollution levels in different areas of the city, in order to sensitize young people awareness of the problem of pollution, teach them how do sensors work and how do tracking and measuring work.</description>
