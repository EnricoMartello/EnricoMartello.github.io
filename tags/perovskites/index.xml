      <description>I presented the results of my semester-long experience at the CNR at 25th EuroSimE, a conference mainly involved in simulations and experiments for microelectronics and microsystems. The focus of this work was on simulating the deposition of a metal-organic perovskite on a substrate, in order to understand the role of the many experimental parameters involved in the innovative deposition technique described in this work.&#xA;Although we did not manage to present a paper, but the poster won the &amp;ldquo;Outstanding poster award&amp;rdquo;, by participants&amp;rsquo; vote.</description>
