      <title>Measuring the Adiabatic Non-Hermitian Berry Phase in Feedback-Coupled Oscillators</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we verify experimentally that the adiabatic non-Hermitian Berry phase is a purely geometrical effect that leads to significant amplification and damping of the amplitude also for non-cyclical paths within the parameter space even when all eigenenergies are real. We further observe a non-Hermitian analog of the Aharonov&amp;ndash;Bohm solenoid effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time since I began my PhD, I was able to spend more time traveling for conferences. In particular, I presented this poster at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/theory/events/iop2022/&#34;&gt;Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of Warwick, then a few weeks later I took part to the conference on &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmqm2022.iopconfs.org/home&#34;&gt;Condensed Matter and Quantum Materials (CMQM)&lt;/a&gt; organised by the Institute of Physics (IoP) at the University of Bath, and finally I have presented it at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, for the conference on &lt;a href=&#34;https://desoeq.phys.strath.ac.uk/desoeqqsum22/&#34;&gt;Designing Out of Eequilibrium many-body Quantum systems (DesOEQ)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;For more details about this work, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02700&#34;&gt;take a look at the paper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As it is a large file, it might take some time to download it - be patient :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From 17th to 20th of September, right before I graduated my MSc, I had the chance to take part (and help managing, together with other MSc students) the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iqis2018.imm.cnr.it/&#34;&gt;11th Italian Quantum Information Science Conference (IQIS)&lt;/a&gt; organised in Catania. Here I presented the work I had carried out during my Erasmus as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lsschollwoeck/members/professors/pollet/&#34;&gt;Lode Pollet&amp;rsquo;s group&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I presented a different version of the poster. The one you find here is a &amp;ldquo;more standalone&amp;rdquo; version, that I presented at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/theory/events/iop2019/&#34;&gt;Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, held in Warwick. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;For more details about this work, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/12/1/20&#34;&gt;take a look at the paper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As it is a large file, it might take some time to download it - be patient :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
