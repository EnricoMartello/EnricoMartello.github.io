      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the final exam of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags/modules/comp/machinelearning/&#34;&gt;MPAGS Machine Learning course&lt;/a&gt; (access the 2021-2022 course pages to see the statement of my assessment being submitted - and passed). I was inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data&#34;&gt;this Kaggle competition&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to try and create a Machine Learning algorithm capable of identifying marine mammals just by a picture of the dorsal fin. Since I am a beginner (or at least I was at the time), I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bdsaglam/happy-whale-512?select=sample_submission.csv&#34;&gt;this dataset&lt;/a&gt;, that consists of the already resized and rotated images of the original dataset (hence it is supposedly easier to work with it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
