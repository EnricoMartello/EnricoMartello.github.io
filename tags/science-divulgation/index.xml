      <description>As one of the active members of De sidus association I was invited to discuss the relation between man and time, and how has the concept of time evolved both on physical ground and in terms of the understanding we have of our world! Together with one of De Sidus member, we discussed at one of the Feltrinelli stores in Catania. Check our video (Italian only, sorry about it)!</description>

      <description>I collaborated with the EPS Young Minds section Catania in their project involving High School students and Arduino. The goal of the project was to build a network of sensors able to track down pollution levels in different areas of the city, in order to sensitize young people awareness of the problem of pollution, teach them how do sensors work and how do tracking and measuring work.</description>
