      <description>Just by chance, a couple of years ago I came across the Advent of Code, and interesting project that I personally recommend to those who want to challenge themselves in doing some code-related problem solving, or who want to test/improve their knowledge of a given programming language. This year I wanted to deepen my knowledge of C++, hence the poor quality of my code. I will improve for sure!</description>
